All you have to do is

1. Click **Deploy to Heroku**
2. Fill in the **Environment Variables** when prompted. These will be a *[Github Access Token](https://github.com/blog/1509-personal-api-tokens)*, which should have Organisation priviledges enabled, and a *Github Organisation name*, and a *background color*. The choices are {blue,green,grey,pink,red,white}. If you don't enter one of those strings it defaults to 'white'.

#### All Done! Just share the Heroku App's URL to people and they'll be able to get themselves an invite to your organisation.
